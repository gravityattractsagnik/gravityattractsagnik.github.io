It was like a nightmare to me. It was always a web of confusion for me until you arrived in my life. You instilled in me the deep-rooted tough concepts with the understanding of simple problems that helped me to solve the hardest problems of HC Verma. It is because of you that Physics became one of my favourite subjects. Being a physics teacher you also made mathematics interesting for me too.  I'am feeling very grateful and filled with happiness to get a teacher like you.<br>Thank you for everything.<br>Happy Teacher's Day.</strong></p>
